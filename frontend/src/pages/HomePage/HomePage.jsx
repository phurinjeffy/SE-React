                Software engineering (SE) is an engineering discipline
                concerning all aspects of software production, including
                software analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment.
                SE requires profound abstract and logical thinking and the
                application of mathematics, logic, and computer science in order
                to produce efficient and reliable software with the available
                resources.

              <br />
              It is hard to overstate the ubiquity of software nowadays. Every
              computer system is governed by software. Almost every human
              activity involves software in some form. Undoubtedly software
              industry is one of the largest and fastest growing industries in
              the world. Consequently, skilled software engineers are in high
              demand worldwide. As software becomes more and more complex, the
              programming skills and the rudimentary knowledge of software
              engineering that students obtained from traditional computer
              science and computer engineering curriculums are insufficient. The
              development of real-world software applications requires the
              skills in analysing the problem domain and the customer's
              requirement and the skills in designing the software from the
              topmost level down to the implementation level. Moreover, a
              software engineer must be able to use proper tools, techniques,
              and methodologies in order to produce the software in an efficient
              manner
